    A planet is being terrorized by giant alien spiders! 
    Do you go down with your crew to save them, or do you leave the planet to die? 
    A pirate ship is stuck to an asteroid, do you try to get them out or simply destroy 
    their ship and scrap what remains? These are all choices you must make while playing 
    Faster Than Light. Faster Than Light, or FTL is a real time strategy (RTS) space game 
    made in a 2D pixel art style, released by the Indie group Subset Games in 2012. 
    In Faster Than Light, you take command of a Federation ship and must navigate through
     the dangers of space while making critical decisions that determine the fate of your 
     crew and the galaxy. All the while you must evade the pursuing rebel fleet that is 
     hot on your tail.
