    A planet is being terrorized by giant alien spiders! 
    Do you go down with your crew to save them, or do you leave the planet to die? 
    A pirate ship is stuck to an asteroid, do you try to get them out or simply destroy 
    their ship and scrap what remains? These are all choices you must make while playing 
    Faster Than Light. Faster Than Light, or FTL, is a real time strategy (RTS) space game 
    made in a 2D pixel art style, released by the Indie group Subset Games in 2012.

        <b><i>Explore the Galaxy</i></b>
        <br>
        In Faster Than Light, you play the role as an officer for the galactic federation.
        The galaxy is in a state of turmoil because of the human rebellion uprising, and you
        must take command of a Federation ship and navigate through the dangers of space in 
        order to deliver critical information to the federation base. Through the adventure you will
        make critical decisions that determine the fate of your crew and the galaxy.

        <b><i>Variety and Depth</i></b>
        <br>
        The sheer amount of variety and depth that is in FTL's combat 
        system elevates the game from other RTS games. There are a myriad of
         weapons, crew, and ship systems. This variety allows the player to 
         mix and match weapons and styles to make whatever they want! The
          variety of weapons and tactics available encourages experimentation
        with different fighting styles and rewards the player for coming up
        with creative solutions to the problems they're met with.

<div id="par_three">
    <p>
        <b><i>Infinite Replayability</i></b>
        <br>
        The use of randomly generated events keeps the gameplay fresh 
        and gives the game incredible replayability. In FTL, every time
         you go to a new beacon, you are met with a randomly generated 
         event that varies based on the sector that you are in. There 
         are hundreds of such random events that you have a chance to 
         encounter every time you warp into a new beacon. There are a 
         total of 8 races in FTL, each that trigger their own events and
          special options. The sheer amount of possible runs in this 
          game makes it so you will never play the same game twice. The 
          unpredictable nature of the game's events keeps players engaged
           and encourages exploration into previously unvisited parts of 
           the galaxy.
